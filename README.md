# cs203s2021-activity8

## DUE: by Tuesday, April 20

## Introduction

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader/), this repository
contains the starter files for a class activity eight. The GitHub Actions CI is not used in this repository.

This assignment invites a developer to explore test driven development.

## Tasks

Problem: identifying if a number is even.

- Create a test case first.

- Write the code.

- Refactor and repeat with a new test case.

## Running Commands

Assuming that you have [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv), and its dependencies correctly installed, you can run the following commands:

Here is a sample of the Pipenv commands that you will need to run
during this assignment.

- Run the test suite with `pytest`: `pipenv run pytest`
- Run the program with `pipenv` and `python3: `pipenv run python3 src/check_even.py`

To run one of these commands, you must be in the main directory for this
assignment where the configuration files are located. Then, you can type these
commands in the terminal and study the output.
